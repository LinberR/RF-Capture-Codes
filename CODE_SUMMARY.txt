To see the results of an experiment, please run the following file in MATLAB:

code/show_experiment.m

To see reconstructed figures, please run the following file in MATLAB:

code/figure_reconstruction.m

calc_body_score.m:->

> A function file.
> Takes two arguments, patch_curr, and noise_floor
> Takes mean of all the values of the patch_curr array, that have their values greater than noise floor.

calculate_patch_scores.m:->

> A function file.
>Inputs:

>> img_shifted - images after swaying compensation
>> chest_z_avg - estimated chest location in z
>> data.walk_start - the frame when the person started walking
>> data.walk_end - the frame when the person stopped walking

> Outputs: 

>> scores - scores for each image patch
>> patches - segmented image patches
>> weight - scores for body image patches
>> weight_leg - scores for leg image patches

> runs the script file: segmentation_parameters.m (This script uses chest_z_avg)
> Defines the following variables:->
>> scores -> a num_frame_used x 9 sized array
>> patches -> a num_frame_used x 9 sized array
>> weight ->
